        <h2>Guidelines for Prevention of Misleading Advertisements and Endorsements for Misleading Advertisements</h2>
        <p>
            On June 09, 2022, the Central Consumer Protection Authority, in exercise of the powers conferred by Section
            18 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, issued the Guidelines for Prevention of Misleading Advertisements
            and Endorsements for Misleading Advertisements, 2022 to provide for the prevention of false or misleading
            advertisements and making endorsements relating thereto.

            These guidelines seek to ensure that consumers are not being fooled with unsubstantiated claims, exaggerated
            promises, misinformation and false claims . As per the release by PIB Delhi, the Guidelines aims to protect
            consumer’s interest through bringing in more transparency and clarity in the way advertisements are being
            published, so that, consumers are able to make informed decisions based on facts rather than false
            narratives and exaggerations .

            Advertisers and their responsibilities:

            Definition of Advertisers:

            • Person who designs, produces and publishes advertisements by his effort or by entrusting them to someone
            else;
            • Includes the manufacturer and service provider of such products .

            Duties and responsibilities:

            Advertisers must ensure that the advertisement meets all the following guidelines:

            1. All claims and descriptions in the advertisement which are based on objective facts must be capable of
            substantiation when required by the Central authority;

            2. Advertisements’ source and date of independent research must be indicated;

            3. No references to a person, firm or institution in a manner which confers an unjustified advantage on the
            advertised product or tends to disrepute the said person, firm or institution unless permission has been
            sought;

            4. No statements or visual presentations which may mislead consumers about the advertised product;

            5. Advertisements must indicate a fixed period of guarantee of the product or a fixed price at which the
            product is offered:

            a. If the product has different periods of guarantee for different parts or components, it shall indicate
            the minimum and maximum of such periods of guarantee applicable to the relevant part or components;

            b. If the advertisements invite the public to participate in lotteries or prize competitions, the material
            terms and conditions must be mentioned so that customers can enable a true and fair view of their prospects
            in such activities.

            Conditions for non-misleading and valid advertisements:

            1. Contains a truthful and honest representation;

            2. Does not mislead consumers by exaggerating the accuracy, scientific validity or practical usefulness or
            the performance or capability of the products;

            3. Does not present legal rights as a distinctive feature of the advertiser’s offer;

            4. Does not suggest claims as universally accepted if there is a significant division of scientific opinion
            relating to such claims;

            5. Does not mislead about the nature or extent of the risk to consumers’ personal security if they fail to
            purchase the advertised product;

            6. Claims based merely on the content of a publication do not mislead consumers;

            7. Complies with the provisions of any other specific law.

            While "misleading advertisements" was already defined under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the
            Guidelines defines "bait advertisements", “surrogate advertisement" and provides what constitutes as "free
            claim advertisements".

            Bait advertisements:

            Definition:

            Advertisement in which the product is offered for sale at a low price to attract customers.

            Conditions:

            1. Advertisement cannot entice consumers to purchase the products without a reasonable prospect of selling
            such advertised products at the price offered;

            2. Advertiser shall ensure that there is an adequate supply of products to meet foreseeable demand generated
            by such advertisement;

            3. Advertisement must state the reasonable grounds which the advertiser has for believing that he might not
            be able to supply the advertised products within a reasonable period and in reasonable quantities:

            a. If estimated demand exceeds supply, it must be mentioned that the stock of products is limited;

            b. If the purpose of the advertisement is to gauge potential demand, it must be stated in the advertisement;

            c. No omission of restrictions including geographic restrictions and age limit on the availability of
            products etc.

            4. Advertisement does not mislead consumers about the market conditions or the lack of their availability to
            induce consumers to purchase the products under such conditions.

            Surrogate advertisements:

            Surrogate advertisements are barred under the law. These are advertisements for products whose advertising
            is prohibited or restricted by law, by disguising such prohibition and portraying it to be the advertisement
            of products which are not restricted. Such advertisements cannot use the brand name, logo, colour, layout
            and presentation associated with prohibited products.

            Free Claims Advertisements:

            Such advertisements cannot describe the product as ‘free’ or ‘without charge’ if the consumer has to pay
            anything other than the unavoidable cost of responding to such advertisement and collecting or paying for
            the delivery of the product. Further, a product cannot be described to be free if the consumer has to pay
            for packing, packaging, handling or administration of such free products, if the cost of response or the
            price of product has been increased, unless the increase is unrelated to the cost of promotion; or the
            quality or quantity of the products has been reduced.

            Endorsements:

            Definition:

            An endorser means an individual or a group of institutions endorsing any products in an advertisement whose
            opinion, belief or experience appears to be the message the advertisement reflects.

            Conditions for Endorsement of advertisements:

            1. Endorsements must reflect the genuine, reasonably current opinion of the endorser making such
            representation;

            2. Endorsement must be based on adequate information or experience about the products;

            3. Endorsement must not be deceptive;

            4. Foreigners are also barred from endorsements which Indian professionals are barred under law.

            Children Targeted Advertisements:

            Advertisements targeting children CAN NOT do the following amongst others:

            1. Encourage dangerous behaviour or condone practices that are detrimental to children's physical health or
            mental wellbeing;

            2. Exaggerate features of products leading to children having unrealistic expectations of products;

            3. Feature personalities from sports, music or cinema for products that under any law requires a health
            warning for such advertisement or cannot be purchased by children;

            4. Use words such as ‘just’ or ‘only’ to make the price of products seem less expensive where such
            advertisement includes additional costs;

            5. Imply that children are likely to be ridiculed or become less popular or disloyal if they do not purchase
            or make use of such products;

            6. Causes children to develop a negative body image;

            7. Gives an impression that products are better than the natural or traditional food which children may be
            consuming;

            8. Advertise junk foods, chips and carbonated beverages on a channel or program for children.

            This is in consonance with Chapter III of ASCI’s The Code for Self-Regulation of Advertising Content in
            India which provides safeguards against the indiscriminate use of advertising in situations or of the
            promotion of products regarded as hazardous or harmful to children.

            Disclaimers in Advertisements:

            1. Disclaimers may expand or clarify a claim made in the advertisements but cannot contradict the material
            claim or the main message conveyed or change the dictionary meaning of the words used in the claims;

            2. Must not hide or attempt to hide material information which would likely make the advertisement deceptive
            or conceal its commercial intent;

            3. Must not attempt to correct a misleading claim made in an advertisement.

            4. Disclaimer shall be in the same language and have the same font as the claim made in the advertisement.

            Guidelines also provide for duties of manufacturer, service provider, advertiser and advertising agency as
            well as due diligence that needs to be carried out before endorsing and others.

            In the event of violation of the Guidelines, CCPA can impose penalty of up to INR 10 lakhs on manufacturers,
            advertisers and endorsers for any misleading advertisements. Moreover, penalty of up to INR 50 lakhs can be
            imposed by CCPA for subsequent contraventions. CCPA may also prohibit the endorser of a misleading
            advertisement from making any endorsement for up to 1 year and for subsequent contravention, prohibition can
            extend up to 3 years.
